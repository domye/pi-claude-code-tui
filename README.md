## Installation

Install from npm globally for your user:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-claude-code-tui
```

Or install it only for the current project:

```bash
pi install -l npm:pi-claude-code-tui
```

Try it for one run without installing:

```bash
pi -e npm:pi-claude-code-tui
```

## What it changes

- Header title: left-aligned `─── Pi v<pi version> ─────` (theme accent color)
- Animated Pi logo matching the dynamic color-changing mark from `curl -fsSL https://pi.dev/install.sh | sh`, settling into the accent color
- Center text: `Let's build something great`
- Shows current model (`provider/id`), thinking effort, and cwd
- Right-side tips panel on wide terminals (narrow sidebar with `…` truncation)
- Keeps pi's original input box and cursor
- Keeps pi's original footer and spinner, with Claude-style rotating working verbs

## Local development

```bash
pi -e .
```

## Commands

- `/use-claude-code-tui` — switch to this package's look (Pi header)
- `/use-default-tui` — switch back to pi's built-in header, footer, and spinner
